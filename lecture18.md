# What is Regression?

:: content ::

<p v-click>

<SpeechBubble color="amber-light" shape="round" position="bl" maxWidth="24rem">
Regression builds directly on correlation — today we move from *describing* relationships to *predicting* outcomes.
</SpeechBubble>

</p>

<p v-click>

- While correlation *describes* a relationship, regression quantifies how much change to expect in one variable given a change in another.

- This lets us use one variable to **predict** another.
</p>

<p v-click>

- **Correlation answers:**
  “Are X and Y related?”

- **Regression answers:**
  “How much does Y change when X changes?”

</p>

# Regression vs. Correlation

:: content ::

- Imagine we have data about ice cream sales per month (in dollars) and the number of shark attacks per month.

<p v-click>

- **Correlation** can tell us that ice cream sales and shark attacks are related ($r = .7$).

</p>

<p v-click>

- But what if we want to **predict** shark attacks based on ice cream sales? For example, if monthly ice cream sales are $5000, how many shark attacks should we expect?

</p>

<p v-click>

- **Regression** allows us to make this prediction by quantifying the relationship between ice cream sales and shark attacks.

# Regression Does Not Tell Us About Causation!

:: content ::
- Even though regression predicts, it **cannot** establish causality.
- Why?
  - Predictors are **not manipulated**.
  - Confounds still exist.
  - Observational data is **not** experimental data.

<p v-click>

**Key idea:**
Regression tells us how we should expect a variable to change *if a predictor changes*, not *why* the change occurs.

</p>

# Regression Variables

:: content ::
In regression, we use **new terms** instead of IV and DV:

- **Predictor variable** (X):
  The variable we use to make our prediction

- **Outcome variable** (Y):
  The variable we want to predict

<p v-click>

Previously, we have used “independent” and “dependent” variable labels. But we have used these terms to describe **experiments** in which our independent variable was manipulated (e.g., condition assignment).

</p>

<p v-click>

In regression, we are often working with **observational data** where no variables are manipulated. Thus, we use the terms **predictor** and **outcome** to avoid implying causality.

# Simple Linear Regression

:: content ::
Simple Linear Regression (SLR):
- Used to **predict an outcome** (Y) based on **one predictor** (X).
- We find the **line of best fit** through the data points.

<p v-click>

$$\hat{Y} = bX + a$$

- **b** = slope
- **a** = intercept
- **Ŷ** = predicted outcome value

</p>

---
layout: top-title

:: title ::
# Understanding the Slope and Intercept

:: content ::

- The **slope (b)** tells us:
 ==How much Y is expected to change when X increases by 1 unit.==

<p v-click>

- If **b > 0** → higher X predicts higher Y (positive relationship)
- If **b < 0** → higher X predicts lower Y (negative relationship)
- If **b = 0** → X does not predict Y

</p>

<p v-click>

- The **intercept (a)** tells us:
 ==The predicted value of Y when X = 0.==

</p>

<p v-click>

- Sometimes X = 0 is not meaningful (e.g., GPA = 0, height = 0) --> remember interval scales!
  - In those cases, the **intercept is still needed mathematically**, but we interpret it cautiously.

</p>

# What Does the Regression Line Represent?

:: content ::

- The regression line is the **prediction rule** for Y based on X.

<p v-click>

- It represents our **best guess** for the average value of Y at each level of X.

</p>

<p v-click>

- Example:
    - A therapist wants to predict their clients' depression scores based on stressful life events.
    - The therapist counts the number of stressful life events for every client in the past 2 years and their current depression scores.
    - The therapist finds that the best fitting regression line has a slope of 2 and an intercept of 10.
    - This means that for each additional stressful life event, the therapist predicts the depression score to increase by 2 points, starting from a baseline of 10 when there are no stressful life events.

# Finding the Regression Line: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

:: content ::

**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** is a common method used to find the **best-fitting line** in simple regression.

It finds the line that **minimizes the total squared prediction error**:

$$
\text{SSE} = \sum (Y - \hat{Y})^2
$$

where:
- **SSE** = Sum of Squared Errors
- **Y** = Actual outcome values
- **Ŷ** = Predicted outcome values from the regression line

### Why squared errors?
- Prevents positive and negative errors from canceling.
- Penalizes **large errors** more than small ones.
- Makes math tractable and guarantees a unique best line.

# OLS: Practice

:: content ::

**Which of the following describes (in words) the best-fitting regression line found using OLS?**

A. The line that has an equal number of points above and below it.

B. The line that minimizes the sum of squared deviations between actual and predicted Y values.

C. The line that best predicts the **mean** of Y.

D. The line with the **largest** slope.

<p v-click>

**Answer: B.**
OLS finds the line with the **smallest sum of squared errors (SSE)**, which is the sum of squared deviations between actual and predicted Y values.

# Error in Prediction

:: content ::

- Regression predictions are **not perfect**.
- There will always be some error in our predictions.
- These errors can come from:
    - **Unexplained variance** in the data (i.e., factors not included in the model)
    - **Random noise** in measurements
    - **Individual differences** among subjects

---
layout: top-title

:: title ::
# Error in Prediction

:: content ::

- The amount of error around the line of best fit can be quantified.
- The ==standard error of the estimate== describes how far away (on average) the data points are from the line of best fit.

<p v-click>

- Computed as:
$$SE_{estimate} = \sqrt{\frac{SSE}{df}}
$$

Where:
- **SSE** = Sum of Squared Errors (from OLS)
- **df** = degrees of freedom
- For simple regression, **df = n - 2** (n = number of data points)

<Admonition title="Question" color="teal-light" width="100%">
How will increasing the number of data points (n) affect the standard error of the estimate?
</Admonition>

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** Increasing the number of data points (n) will generally **decrease** the standard error of the estimate. This is because a larger sample size provides more information about the population, leading to more accurate estimates of the regression parameters.

# Proportionate Reduction in Error (PRE)

:: content ::
- PRE quantifies how much more accurate our predictions become when using regression versus simply using the **mean** of Y.
- It is calculated as:

$$PRE = \frac{SSE_{mean} - SSE_{regression}}{SSE_{mean}}$$


<p v-click>

This is the same as our earlier definition of R²: Variance explained by the regression model!

$$PRE = R^2$$

This is also called the **coefficient of determination**.

</p>

# Proportionate Reduction in Error (PRE)

Interpreting R²:
- **R² = 0** → regression does not improve prediction
- **R² = 1** → perfect prediction
- **R² = .40** → 40% of variance explained

# Proportionate Reduction in Error (PRE)

:: content ::

$$PRE = \frac{SSE_{mean} - SSE_{regression}}{SSE_{mean}}$$


<p v-click>

This is very similar to the formula for R² or $\eta^2$ in ANOVA:

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{between}}{SS_{total}}$$

</p>

<br>

<p v-click>

Our numerators reflect the ==amount of variance explained by the model==, and our denominators reflect the ==total variance in the outcome variable==.

</p>

<p v-click>

- Thus, R² in regression and $\eta^2$ in ANOVA both quantify the **proportion of variance explained** by the model.
- They are measures of **effect size**.

:: title ::
# R² and Significance Testing

:: content ::

- **R²** tells us how much variance in Y is explained by the regression model.
  → It is an **effect size**.

<p v-click>

- We can also ask: **Is this R² likely to be > 0 in the population, or could it be due to chance?**
  - In simple regression, this is equivalent to testing whether the **slope = 0** (or *r* = 0).
  - Like with an ANOVA, we can use an **F-test** to determine whether the overall regression model explains a significant amount of variance in Y.
  - We use an ***F*-test** for the overall model.
  - We use a *t* test for the slope.
</p>



<p v-click>

- Remember, our test statistic values depend on both effect size and sample size.
  - With a large enough sample, even a small R² can be statistically significant.

# Unstandardized Coefficients

:: content ::
- Regression coefficients can be reported in **unstandardized** or **standardized** form.
- ==Unstandardized coefficients== are reported in the **original units** of the variables.

**Unstandardized slope (b)**
- Interpreted in **raw units**
- Example: “For each additional stressful event, depression scores increase by 3.2 points.”

**Intercept (a)**
- Predicted Y when X = 0 (may or may not be meaningful)

:: title ::
# Standardized Coefficients

:: content ::
- Standardized coefficients are reported in **standard deviation units**.
- Variables are standardized (z-scored) before running the regression.

**Standardized slope (β)**
- Interpreted in **standard deviation units**
- Example: “For each additional standard deviation increase in stressful events, depression scores increase by 0.45 standard deviations.”

**Intercept (β₀)**
- Predicted Y when X is at its mean (i.e., when standardized X = 0)

# Example: Unstandardized vs. Standardized Coefficients

:: content ::
Imagine you are predicting house prices based on square footage and number of bedrooms.

- **Unstandardized coefficients:**
  - Slope ($b$) for square footage = 150 (each additional square foot increases price by $150)
  - Slope ($b$) for number of bedrooms = 20,000 (each additional bedroom increases price by $20,000)

<p v-click>

**Which predictor has a larger impact on price?**

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** It depends on the scale of the predictors. Square footage is measured in hundreds or thousands, while number of bedrooms is a small integer. Thus, we cannot directly compare their unstandardized coefficients.

Imagine you are predicting house prices based on square footage and number of bedrooms.


<p v-click>

- **Standardized coefficients:**
  - Slope (β) for square footage = 0.6
  - Slope (β) for number of bedrooms = 0.4

</p>

<p v-click>

**Now, which predictor has a larger impact on price?**

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** Square footage has a larger impact on price, as indicated by its higher standardized coefficient (β = 0.6 vs. β = 0.4).

# Multiple Regression

:: content ::

Multiple regression predicts an outcome using **2+ predictors**:


$$\hat{Y} = b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \dots + a$$

Examples:
- Predict GPA from hours studied + attendance
- Predict depression from stress + sleep + social support

<p v-click>

### Key idea:
Each slope (**b₁**, **b₂**, …) represents the relationship between that predictor and Y **holding all other predictors constant**.

This makes regression different from simple correlations.

</p>

:: title ::
# Multiple Predictors

:: content ::

Imagine predicting Y from **two** predictors: X₁ and X₂.

Each predictor explains a **different slice of variance**.


<p v-click>

### Why use multiple predictors?
- Increases accuracy
- Reduces omitted-variable bias
- Helps control for confounds

</p>

# Multiple Predictors

:: content ::

*You want to understand how stress and sleep relate to depression.*
- You first run a simple linear regression predicting depression from sleep alone. You find that sleep significantly predicts depression ($b = -2, p < .01$).
- However, you then run a ==multiple regression== including both stress and sleep as predictors.
    - Here, you find that stress significantly predicts depression ($b = 3, p < .001$), but sleep no longer significantly predicts depression ($b = -0.5, p = .15$).

**What do these two findings suggest?**

A. Sleep is not related to depression.

B. Stress predicts sleep.

C. Stress explains some of the same variance in depression as sleep.

D. Stress and sleep are unrelated.

<p v-click>

**Answer: C.**  If including stress in the model reduces the effect of sleep on depression, it suggests that stress and sleep share some variance in predicting depression.

# Interaction Terms in Regression

:: content ::

- An **interaction** occurs when the effect of one predictor **depends on** the level of another predictor.

- In other words:

    - ==The relationship between X₁ and Y changes depending on X₂.==

<p v-click>

- This is the same as in ANOVA, where the effect of one IV depends on the level of another IV.

</p>

<p v-click>

**Example:**  The effect of stress on depression may depend on social support.
- High social support may buffer the negative effect of stress on depression.

</p>

<br>

<p v-click>

*To test for interactions in regression, we include an **interaction term** in the model:*

$$\hat{Y} = b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3(X_1 \times X_2) + a$$

*The best-fitting regression line predicting stress level (Y) from hours of sleep (X) is:*

$$\hat{Y} = 22 - 1.5X$$

**What does the intercept (22) represent?**

A. Predicted stress level when sleep = 0 hours

B. Average stress level in the sample

C. Minimum stress score possible

<p v-click>

**Answer: A.**
The intercept represents the predicted stress level when the predictor (hours of sleep) is equal to 0.
</p>

<p v-click>

**How should we interpret this intercept in practical terms?**


</p>

<p v-click>

Since 0 hours of sleep is not a realistic scenario, the intercept may not have a meaningful interpretation in this context. It is primarily a mathematical necessity for the regression equation.

# Regression: Practice Questions

:: content ::
A study predicts college GPA using SAT score (X₁) and high school GPA (X₂).

When SAT score is used alone, it significantly predicts college GPA ($b = 0.03, p < .01$). When both SAT score and high school GPA are included as predictors in the model, the slope for SAT becomes non-significant.

**What is the best interpretation of this result?**

A. SAT does not predict college GPA at all.

B. SAT only predicts GPA for high-performing students.

C. SAT and high school GPA explain overlapping variance.

D. High school GPA causes SAT performance.

<p v-click>

**Answer: C.**

Including high school GPA in the model accounts for some of the same variance in college GPA that SAT score explains, leading to a non-significant slope for SAT.

A regression predicts happiness from daily exercise duration. The slope is $b = 1.4, p = .28.$

**Which conclusion is correct?**

A. Exercise has no effect on happiness.

B. We failed to find evidence that exercise predicts happiness.

C. Exercise decreases happiness.

D. The effect size is zero.

<p v-click>

**Answer: B.**
A non-significant p-value indicates that we did not find evidence that exercise duration predicts happiness in this sample. It does not prove that there is no effect in the population.
