# From Between-Groups to Repeated-Measures ANOVA

:: content ::

- Recall: The **one-way between-groups ANOVA** compares means from **independent samples**.

<p v-click>

- What if the **same participants** complete **multiple conditions**?

</p>

<p v-click>

- We use a **repeated-measures ANOVA**, also called a **within-groups ANOVA.**
</p>

<p v-click>

- Just like with *t*-tests, we have a between-groups and a within-groups version of ANOVA.

# When to Use a Repeated-Measures ANOVA

:: content ::
Use when:
- The **same participants** are measured across **three or more conditions.**
- There is **one independent variable (IV)** with 3+ levels.
- The dependent variable (DV) is **numeric** (interval or ratio).

<p v-click>

<Admonition title="Question" color="teal-light" width="100%">
In which of these scenarios would a Repeated-Measures ANOVA be appropriate?
</Admonition>

1. Testing memory performance after 0, 1, and 2 cups of coffee with the same participants.

2. Comparing test scores of students from three different schools.

3. Measuring reaction times of the same participants under three different lighting conditions.

4. Evaluating how number of hours of sleep per night relates to GPA.

# Advantages of Repeated-Measures ANOVA

:: content ::
- **Accounts for individual differences** – the same people are in every condition.

- **Increases statistical power** – less error variance.

- **Fewer participants** needed.

<p v-click>

Essentially, every participant acts as their **own control group.**

</p>

<p v-click>

==**This should sound familiar from within-groups t-tests!**==

# Disadvantages of Within-Groups Designs

:: content ::
- **Carryover** effects:
  - Once participants have experienced one condition, it may influence their behavior in subsequent conditions.
- **Order effects**:
    - Practice effects: Improvement due to familiarity with the task.
    - Fatigue effects: Decline in performance due to tiredness or boredom.
  - ==Counterbalancing== can help mitigate this issue, but it may not eliminate it entirely.

What is one way you could mitigate the influence of practice effects in your experimental design?
</Admonition>

A. Increase your sample size to reduce the influence of practice effects.

B. Counterbalance the order of conditions across participants to ensure that the influence of practice equally affects all conditions.

C. Ask participants to promise not to practice between sessions.

D. All of the above.

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer: B** – Counterbalancing helps distribute practice effects evenly across conditions, reducing their confounding influence.

# Between- vs. Repeated-Measures ANOVA

- In both cases, we are still using the *F* ratio: Between-Groups Variance / Within-Groups Variance.

# Calculations in a Repeated-Measures ANOVA

:: content ::
- Remember, for between-groups ANOVA, we partition total variability into:
$$
SS_{Total} = SS_{Between} + SS_{Within}
$$

<p v-click>

- **SS<sub>Between</sub>:** variability due to condition means.
- **SS<sub>Within</sub>:** variability due to random noise.

</p>

<p v-click>

Importantly, in a between-groups design, this ==random noise== includes all sources of variability within conditions, including  individual differences between participants.

</p>

<p v-click>

- The logic is similar to between-groups ANOVA, **but we add one more term:**

$$
SS_{Total} = SS_{Between} + SS_{Within} + SS_{Subjects}
$$

</p>

<p v-click>

- **SS<sub>Subjects</sub>:** variability due to stable individual differences between participants.
- **SS<sub>Within</sub>** now reflects variability due to random noise only, after removing variability due to individual differences.

</p>

# Calculating the Subjects Sum of Squares

:: content ::
To calculate ==**SS<sub>Subjects</sub>**==:
1. Compute each participant's overall mean across all conditions ($M_{participant}$).
2. For each participant, calculate the squared difference between their overall mean and the grand mean ($GM$).
3. Sum these squared differences across all $n$ participants.

<SpeechBubble color="amber-light" shape="round" position="bl" maxWidth="24rem">
Remember, the **grand mean** is the mean of all scores across all participants and conditions.
</SpeechBubble>

<p v-click>
In equation form:

$$
SS_{Subjects} = \sum_{1}^{n} ( M_{participant} - GM )^2
$$

- df<sub>Subjects</sub> = ==n − 1==, *where n = number of subjects*
   - when calculating variability due to individual differences, we lose one degree of freedom from our calculation of the overall mean.

<p v-click>

- df<sub>Within</sub> = ==(k-1)*(n-1)==
   - when calculating variability within conditions, we lose (k-1) degrees of freedom for conditions and (n-1) degrees of freedom for subjects.
</p>

<p v-click>

- Total df = ==N − 1==, *where N = (n\*k), total number of observations (scores)*
   - when calculating total variability, we lose one degree of freedom from our calculation of the grand mean.

<Admonition title="Question" color="teal-light" width="100%">
Why do we often have *two* critical values for a *t* test but only one critical value for an *F* test?
</Admonition>

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** Because *t* tests can be one-tailed or two-tailed, while *F* tests are always one-tailed, because we are always testing whether the variance between groups is greater than the variance within groups.

# Accounting for individual variance increases power

#### Example:
- Imagine BU asks students to rate their satisfaction (from 0 - 1) with three different dining halls.
- They ask 10 different students to rate three dining halls.
- They plot the mean responses and include error bars that show +/- 1 SE from each mean:

</p>

:: title ::

# Accounting for individual variance increases power

:: content ::
- However, some of this variability is due to individual differences among students.
- To account for this, we can subtract each student's overall mean rating from their dining hall ratings. This gives us each student's rating of each dining hall after accounting for individual differences.
- We can then re-compute the standard error of each mean rating and re-plot.

# Effect Size for Repeated-Measures ANOVA

:: content ::
Effect size is measured using **R² (or η²)**:

$$
η² = \frac{SS_{Between}}{SS_{Total} - SS_{Subjects}}
$$

This shows the **proportion of variance explained** by the IV after removing variance due to individual differences.

<p v-click>
Example interpretation: η² = .40 → 40% of variance in performance is explained by the condition.

# Repeated-Measures ANOVA in R

:: content ::
Use the `aov()` function with a within-subjects design:

```r
# Example dataset
data <- data.frame(
  subject = rep(1:10, each = 3),
  condition = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), times = 10),
  score = c(5, 6, 7, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9,
            6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 7, 8, 9)
)

# Run the repeated-measures ANOVA
anova_result <- aov(score ~ condition + Error(subject/condition), data = data)
summary(anova_result)
```

- The `Error(subject/condition)` term specifies the within-subjects design.
- This indicates that each `subject` experiences all levels of `condition`.

# Next Steps After a Significant Repeated-Measures ANOVA

:: content ::
- A significant ANOVA indicates that at least one condition mean differs, but it doesn't tell us which ones.
- Follow up with post-hoc tests (e.g., pairwise t-tests, Tukey's HSD) to explore specific group differences.
- Can use corrections (e.g., Bonferroni) to control for Type I error.

# Recap: Repeated-Measures ANOVA

:: content ::
- A repeated-measures ANOVA is used when the **same participants** complete **3+ conditions.**
- Remember, the *F* statistic compares variability between condition means to variability within conditions.
- When the *same participants* complete all conditions, some of that within-condition variability can be attributed to individual differences.
   - Mathematically, accounts for **individual differences** by computing SS<sub>Subjects</sub> and subtracting that from SS<sub>Within</sub>.
- Increases **statistical power**: SS<sub>Within</sub> reflects only *random* error.

# Why Use a Two-Way ANOVA?

:: content ::
A **Two-Way ANOVA** allows us to test **two independent variables simultaneously.**

Example: ⛷️ Do ski resorts exaggerate weekend snow reports?

<img src="/images/lecture15/interaction_barplot.png" class="w-1/2 mx-auto"/>

# Why Use a Two-Way ANOVA?

With a two-way ANOVA, we can simultaneously test:

<p v-click>

1️⃣ Main effect of Report Source: **Does the source of the report (Resort vs. Weather Station) affect the reported snow levels?**

<img src="/images/lecture15/source_barplot.png" class="w-1/2 mx-auto"/>

</p>

2️⃣ Main effect of Day: **Do weekday vs. weekend reports differ in snow levels?**

<img src="/images/lecture15/day_barplot.png" class="w-1/2 mx-auto"/>

</p>


<p v-click>

3️⃣ Interaction between Report Source × Day: **Does the effect of report source depend on whether it's a weekday or weekend?**

# Structure of a Two-Way ANOVA

:: content ::
- A two-way ANOVA involves **two independent variables (IVs).**
- These IVs can each have **two or more levels.**

- In a **2 × 2 design**, there are two independent variables, each with two levels.

- Each unique combination = a **cell** in the design.

<p v-click>

| **Source** | **Weekday** | **Weekend** |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Resort Report | Mean₁ | Mean₂ |
| Weather Station | Mean₃ | Mean₄ |



- Each cell's mean reflects one condition combination (e.g., Resort–Weekend).

# What Does a Two-Way ANOVA Test?

:: content ::
A Two-Way ANOVA produces **three *F* statistics:**

1️⃣ *F₁*: Main effect of IV₁
2️⃣ *F₂*: Main effect of IV₂
3️⃣ *F₃*: Interaction between IV₁ × IV₂

<p v-click>

- Each *F* statistic tests a specific hypothesis about the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable.
</p>

<p v-click>

- Each *F* statistic is computed similarly to a one-way ANOVA:
$$ F = \frac{MS_{Between}}{MS_{Within}} $$

</p>

<p v-click>

- This is because we are still computing the ratio of variability ==between== condition means (e.g., 'signal') to variability ==within== conditions (e.g., 'noise').

</p>


---
layout: top-title

:: title ::
# Computing *F* statistics for Two-Way ANOVAs

:: content ::

- We compute separate $SS_{Between}$, $MS_{Between}$, $df$, and critical values for all of our effects of interest:

   1️⃣ Main effect of IV₁ (e.g., Report Source)

   2️⃣ Main effect of IV₂ (e.g., Day)

   3️⃣ Interaction between IV₁ × IV₂ (e.g., Report Source × Day)

<br>


<p v-click>

- However, they all share the same $SS_{Within}$ and $MS_{Within}$, which reflect variability within "cells."
   - This is because the within-groups variability is the same regardless of which effect we are testing.
   - Remember, when calculating $SS_{Within}$, we are looking at variability within each cell (condition combination), summed across all cells.

# Marginal Means in Two-Way ANOVA

:: content ::
- **Marginal means** are the means for each level of one IV, averaged across levels of the other IV.
- For example, in our ski resort example:
   - Marginal mean for Resort Report = Average of (Resort–Weekday + Resort–Weekend)
   - Marginal mean for Weather Station = Average of (Weather Station–Weekday + Weather Station–Weekend)
- We use marginal means to assess **main effects** in a two-way ANOVA.

# Understanding interactions in ANOVA

:: content ::

- An interaction occurs when the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable depends on the level of the other independent variable.
- In our ski resort example, the effect of Report Source (Resort vs. Weather Station) on reported snow levels changes depending on whether it's a Weekday or Weekend.
- Often, it is difficult to understand interactions just from the output of statistical tests.

   --> ==**Visualization**== is key!

Which effects are statistically significant at α = .05?
</Admonition>

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** Day (p < .001) and Source:Day interaction (*p* = .00497) are significant. Source (*p* = .05907) is not significant at α = .05.

What is the interpretation of these results in words?
</Admonition>

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** The results suggest that the day of the week has a significant effect on reported snow levels, with weekends generally having higher reports. Additionally, the interaction between report source and day indicates that the difference between the two sources varies by day, with resorts exaggerating reports more on weekends compared to weekdays.

# Why use a two-way ANOVA?

:: content ::

- A two-way ANOVA allows us to compare:
   1. How levels from TWO independent variables affect the dependent variable
   2. How the combined (interaction) effects of those two independent variables affect the dependent variable
- A two-way ANOVA is a hypothesis test that includes:
   - Two nominal (or ordinal) independent variables
      - The number of levels of each IV doesn't matter
   - One numeric (interval or ratio) dependent variable

# Why design a study with two IVs?

:: content ::

- It is often more efficient to evaluate more than one independent variable in a single study.
- It allows us to explore interactions between independent variables!
- Any ANOVA with two or more independent variables is called a **factorial ANOVA**.

# What if one IV is within-groups and the other is between-groups?

:: content ::

- This is called a ==mixed-design ANOVA.== The calculations are more complex (and outside the scope of this course), but the logic is the same.

<p v-click>

<Admonition title="Question" color="teal-light" width="100%">
Which of the following studies would likely use a mixed-design ANOVA?
</Admonition>

A. Testing how day of the week and report source affect snow reports.

B. Testing how students in different sections of PS 211 perform on exams 1, 2, and 3.

C. Testing how first-years vs. sophomores rate their satisfaction with three different dining halls.

D. All of the above.

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer: D** – All of the above!

# What if we have *lots* of independent variables?

:: content ::

- Multifactorial ANOVA can handle **more than two independent variables.**
- The logic is the same: we can test main effects for each IV and interactions between any combination of IVs.
- However, as the number of IVs increases, the complexity of the design and the required sample size also increase.

<p v-click>

- A three-way ANOVA would involve:
   - Three main effects (one for each IV)
   - Three two-way interactions (IV₁ × IV₂, IV₁ × IV₃, IV₂ × IV₃)
   - One three-way interaction (IV₁ × IV₂ × IV₃)
   - ==7== *F* statistics in total!

- A four-way ANOVA would involve:
   - Four main effects
   - Six two-way interactions
   - Four three-way interactions
   - One four-way interaction
   - ==15== *F* statistics in total!
</p>

<p v-click>

**Example:**
- A researcher may want to examine how teaching method, class size, time of day, and student class year affect student performance on exams.
- They would have one numeric dependent variable (exam performance) and four categorical independent variables (teaching method, class size, time of day, and class year).

# Two-Way ANOVA in Action:

:: left ::
- In a 2012 study (Moss-Rascusin et al.), researchers investigated how applicant gender influenced science faculty members' evaluations of lab manager job applications.
- Faculty evaluated identical job applications labeled “John” or “Jennifer.”
- Researchers ran a two-way ANOVA to analyze how labeled gender (male vs. female) and faculty participant gender (here, male vs. female) influenced ratings of the applicants' competence.

- **IV₁:** Applicant Gender
- **IV₂:** Faculty Gender
- **DV:** Competence Rating

:: right ::

<p v-click>

==**Finding:**==
- Both male and female faculty rated "John" as more competent than "Jennifer."

</p>

<p v-click>

<Admonition title="Question" color="teal-light" width="100%">
How would you interpret this finding in terms of main effects and interactions?
</Admonition>

A. There is a main effect of Applicant Gender.

B. There is a main effect of Faculty Gender.

C. There is an interaction between Applicant Gender and Faculty Gender.

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer: A** – There is a main effect of Applicant Gender: both male and female faculty rated "John" as more competent than "Jennifer." There is no main effect of Faculty Gender, and no interaction

# Reporting Two-Way ANOVA Results (APA Style)

:: content ::
When reporting:
- Mention the type of ANOVA (e.g., 2 × 2 between-groups)
- Include *F*, df, *p*, and η² for each main effect and interaction

Example:
> A 2 × 2 ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of applicant gender, *F*(1, 120) = 5.12, *p* = .026, *η²* = .04, on competence ratings, with male applicants rated more competent than female applicants. There was no main effect of faculty gender, nor was there an interaction between applicant gender and faculty gender (*ps* > .05).
