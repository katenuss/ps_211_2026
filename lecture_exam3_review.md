# Review: APA Style Reporting

:: content ::

**Practice question:** Which of the following is the correct way to report the results of a single-sample *t* test in APA style? Imagine the first part of the sentence read, "A single-sample *t* test revealed that the sample mean (M = 15.2, SD = 4.5) was significantly higher than the population mean (μ = 12), "

A. *t*(29) = 2.45, *p* < .05, *d* = 0.45

B. *t* = 2.45, *df* = 29, *p* = .03, *d* = 0.45

C. *t*(29) = 2.45, *p* = .03, *d* = 0.45

D. t(29) = 2.45, p = .03, Cohen's d = 0.45

<p v-click>

**Answer:** C
- The correct APA style reporting includes the test statistic, degrees of freedom in parentheses, the *p* value, and the effect size. Optionally, you can also include the confidence interval.

# Review: APA Style Reporting

:: content ::

**Practice question:** What's wrong with the following APA style reporting of a paired-samples *t* test? "A paired-samples *t* test indicated that the mean score on the post-test was significantly higher than the mean score on the pre-test, *t*(24) = 3.12, *p* = .004, *d* = 0.62, 95% CI \[1.2, 4.5]."

A. The means and standard deviations should be reported.

B. The degrees of freedom should not be included.

C. The *p* value should only be reported to two decimal places.

D. There is nothing wrong with this reporting.



<p v-click>

**Answer:** 
A. The means and standard deviations for both the pre-test and post-test should be reported to provide context for the results.

# Review: *t* Tests 

:: content ::

- The *t* test is used to compare means when the population standard deviation is unknown.
- ==Types== of *t* tests:
  - Single-sample *t* test: Compares a sample mean to a known population mean.
  - Paired-samples *t* test: Compares means from the same group at different times or under different conditions.
  - Independent-samples *t* test: Compares means from two different groups.
- Key ==assumptions== of *t* tests:
  - The data are numeric.
  - The data are collected from a random sample.
  - The observations are independent (for independent-samples *t* tests).

$$ t = \frac{M - \mu}{SE} $$

Where:
-  $M$ is the sample mean
-  $μ$ is the population mean
    - In a single-sample *t* test, this is a known value.
    - In a paired-samples *t* test, this is the mean of the difference scores under the null hypothesis (which is 0).
    - In an independent-samples *t* test, this is the difference between the two sample means under the null hypothesis (which is 0).
-  $SE$ is the standard error of the mean

$$ t = \frac{M_D}{SE_{Difference}} $$

#### Independent-Samples *t* Test
$$ t = \frac{M_1 - M_2}{SE_{Difference}} $$


<p v-click>

- Can think of all these equations as representing a ratio of =="signal"== (the difference between the sample mean and population mean) to =="noise"== (the variability in the data, represented by the standard error).

**Practice question:** What happened to the population mean (μ) in the paired-samples and independent-samples *t* test formulas?
</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** The population mean (μ) is replaced by the mean of the difference scores (for paired-samples) or the difference between the two sample means (for independent-samples) under the null hypothesis, which is assumed to be 0.

**Practice question:** If you run a *t* test and do not observe a significant effect, in which cases would you expect your confidence interval to include 0?

A. Paired-samples *t* test, independent-samples *t* test, and single-sample *t* test.

B. Paired-samples *t* test only.

C. Independent-samples *t* test only.

D. Paired -samples *t* test and independent-samples *t* test only.

</p>

<p v-click>

**Answer:** D
- The confidence interval for the mean difference in paired-samples *t* tests and the difference between means in independent-samples *t* tests is constructed around the observed ==difference.== If the observed difference is not statistically significant, the confidence interval is likely to include 0, indicating no difference. In a single-sample *t* test, the confidence interval is constructed around the sample mean, so it may not include 0 even if the result is not significant.

# Review: Paired-Samples *t* Tests: The Comparison Distribution

:: content ::

- When we run a paired-samples *t* test, we are comparing our distribution of sample mean differences to a comparison distribution.
- The comparison distribution is the distribution of mean differences that we would expect to see if the null hypothesis were true.
  - Because this distribution reflects the ==null hypothesis==, **its mean will *always* be 0.**

  <p v-click>

  - However, the spread of this distribution (i.e., its standard error) will depend on the variability in our data and our sample size.
    - Why? Because even if the null hypothesis were true, ==we would still see some variability in the mean differences due to random sampling error.==
    - The amount of variability we would expect to see in the mean differences is captured by the standard error of the difference scores, which takes into account both the variability in the difference scores and the sample size.

# Review: Paired-Samples *t* Tests: The Comparison Distribution

:: content ::

- Imagine that we want to determine whether students run faster after drinking a cup of coffee.
- Now imagine that the null hypothesis is true: **drinking coffee has no effect on run times.**
- If we were to conduct our study with three students, we might still observe some differences in their run times before and after drinking coffee, just due to random chance.
- If student run times were highly variable, we would expect to see even larger differences in their run times before and after drinking coffee, again just due to random chance.
- However, if we increased our sample size to 300 students, we would expect the differences in run times to become more consistent and less influenced by random chance.
- ==This is why the standard error of our comparison distribution depends on both our sample size and the variability of the data.==

# Review: Paired-Samples *t* Tests: The Comparison Distribution

:: content ::

- Our *t* statistic tells us where (how many standard errors away from mean) in this comparison distribution our observed mean difference falls.
- A larger absolute value of *t* indicates that our observed mean difference is further away from the mean of the comparison distribution.
- If our *t* statistic is large enough (i.e., falls in the critical region), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the two conditions.

# Review: Paired-Samples *t* Tests: The Comparison Distribution

:: content ::

**Practice question:** Why are we more likely to find a significant effect with a larger sample size?

A. Larger sample sizes will both increase our *t* statistic AND change the shape of the *t* distribution, decreasing the critical value needed to reach significance.

B. Larger sample sizes will increase our *t* statistic, but will not change the shape of the *t* distribution.

C. Larger sample sizes will change the shape of the *t* distribution, decreasing the critical value needed to reach significance, but will not affect our *t* statistic.

D. Larger sample sizes will increase our effect size.

<p v-click>

**Answer:** A
- Larger sample sizes decrease the standard error, which increases the *t* statistic. Additionally, larger sample sizes lead to a *t* distribution that more closely resembles the normal distribution, which has lower critical values for significance.

# Review: Independent-Samples *t* Tests: The Comparison Distribution

:: content ::

- Independent-samples *t* tests compare means from two different groups.
- The comparison distribution for an independent-samples *t* test is the distribution of differences between sample means that we would expect to see if the null hypothesis were true.
- Because this distribution reflects the ==null hypothesis==, **its mean will *always* be 0.**
- However, the spread of this distribution (i.e., its standard error) will depend on the variability in our data and our sample sizes in both groups.
- The standard error of the difference between means takes into account both the variability in each group and the sample sizes of each group.

# Review: How do we compute the standard error for an independent-samples *t* test?

:: content ::

## Five steps to compute the standard error:
1. Compute each sample's variance (s²).  
2. Compute the pooled variance (s²pooled).
3. Convert the pooled variance from the squared standard deviation (SD²) to the squared standard error (SE²). Remember the squared SD IS the pooled variance.  
4. Add the two squared standard errors together to get the variance of the difference between means (SE²difference).
5. Take the square root of the variance of the difference to get the standard error of the difference between means (SEdifference).

**Practice question:** Which of the following is NOT a computation involved in conducting an independent-samples *t* test?

A. Compute each sample's variance (s²).
 
B. Compute the pooled variance (s²pooled).

C. Compute the mean of the two sample means. 

D. Convert the pooled variance from the squared standard deviation (SD²) to the squared standard error (SE²).  


<p v-click>

**Answer:** C
- There is no reason to compute the mean of the two sample means when conducting an independent-samples *t* test. The focus is on the difference between the two means, not their average.

# Review: Independent-Samples *t* Tests

:: content ::

**Practice question:** Why do we compute the pooled variance in an independent-samples *t* test?

A. We have two different samples, so we need to combine their variances to get a better estimate of the population variance.

B. This enables us to calculate the difference between the sample means.

C. We need the pooled variance so we know which sample has more variability.



<p v-click>

**Answer:** A

- In an independent-samples *t* test, we compute the pooled variance to combine the variances from both samples, providing a more accurate estimate of the population variance when the two groups are assumed to have equal variances.

# Review: Independent-Samples *t* Tests

:: content ::

**Practice question:** In which of these scenarios would you use an independent-samples *t* test?

A. You want to know if there is a difference in SAT scores between students at BU, BC, Northeastern, and Harvard.

B. You want to know if the number of shark attacks each month relates to the average monthly temperature.

C. You want to know if student responses on an ordinal scale measuring satisfaction with library services (e.g., strongly agree to strongly disagree) differs between undergraduate and graduate students.

D. None of the above.


<p v-click>

**Answer:** D
  - A involves more than two independent groups.
  - B involves two *continuous* variables, not two groups.
  - C involves an ordinal variable, which violates a key assumption of the *t* test: that the data are numeric.

# Review: Independent-Samples *t* Tests

:: content ::

**Practice question:** If you decide to run a one-tailed independent-samples *t* test instead of a two-tailed test, which of the following is TRUE?

A. You will need a larger *t* statistic to reach significance.

B. You will need a smaller *t* statistic to reach significance.

C. The shape of the *t* distribution will change.

D. None of the above.


<p v-click>

**Answer:** B
- In a one-tailed test, all of the alpha level is allocated to one tail of the distribution, making it easier to reach significance in that direction, which means you will need a smaller *t* statistic to reach significance. For example, if you are using an alpha level of .05, the critical value for a two-tailed test would be split between both tails (i.e., .025 in each tail), whereas in a one-tailed test, the entire .05 would be in one tail. This means you would need to find a *t* statistic above the 95th percentile, instead of above the 97.5th percentile, to reject the null hypothesis.
