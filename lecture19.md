# Review: Correlation and Regression

:: left ::

### **Correlation**
- Measures **strength and direction** of a linear relationship
- Measure of how X and Y vary together relative to how much they vary individually
- Symmetric: $r(X,Y) = r(Y,X)$
    - The correlation between X and Y is the same as between Y and X
- Ranges from −1 to +1
- Unitless
- Describes association only; no prediction

:: right ::

<p v-click>

### **Regression**
- Predicts **Y from X** using a best-fit line
- Computed by minimizing squared errors between observed and predicted Y values
- Asymmetric: $Y = bX + a  ≠  X = b'Y + a'$
    - Predicting Y from X differs from predicting X from Y
- Ranges from −∞ to +∞
- Units matter
- Used for prediction.

# Significance Testing: Correlation & Regression

:: content ::

<p v-click>

- Correlation and regression both assess linear relationships between variables.
- These relationships can be tested for **statistical significance.**

</p>

<p v-click>

- *Null hypothesis:* There is no linear association between X and Y (correlation = 0; slope = 0).
- *Alternative hypothesis:* There is a linear association between X and Y (correlation ≠ 0; slope ≠ 0).

</p>

<p v-click>

- For both, the test statistic depends on sample size (n) and effect size (r or slope).
- Larger samples → more power to detect smaller effects.
- Just like with all our inferential tests, ==**the p-value indicates probability of observing data if null is true.**==

</p>

# Relation between correlation & regression

:: content ::

<p v-click>

- If there is a linear relationship between X and Y, **both** correlation and regression will capture it.
- If there is no linear relationship, both will indicate no association.

</p>

<p v-click>


- The regression slope can be very, very small even if correlation is strong, depending on the scales of X and Y.

</p>

<p v-click>

- Correlation quantifies ==strength of association.==
- Regression quantifies ==change in Y per unit change in X.==

</p>

# Relation between ANOVA & regression

:: content ::
- ANOVA can be viewed as a special case of regression where the predictor(s) is/are ==categorical.==
- Remember, ANOVA asks: Is the variance between group means larger than the variance within groups?
    - In regression terms, this is equivalent to asking: Does knowing the group membership (categorical predictor) help predict the outcome variable?

<p v-click>

- Both ANOVA and regression use the same underlying principles of determining ==how much variance in the outcome can be explained by the predictors== versus how much remains unexplained (error).

</p>

<p v-click>

- Both can handle multiple predictors (factors in ANOVA; variables in regression), interactions, and mixed designs (combinations of within- and between-subjects factors/variables).

</p>

# Review of Inferential Statistics: The Core Idea

::left::

### Why do we need inferential statistics?
- We typically observe **samples**, not populations.
    - Remember, samples are just subsets of the larger population we care about.
- We want to make **inferences** about populations.
    - For example, when we're testing a treatment for depression, we want to know if it works for all people with depression, not just the people who happen to be in our study.

::right::

<p v-click>

### Variability in Samples

- Samples have **variability** due to many factors.
    - Sampling error: random variability between samples
    - Measurement error: imprecision in our measurements
    - Individual differences: true variability among people
    - **True population variability: differences in the population that we care about!**

</p>

:: title ::
# Review of Inferential Statistics: The Core Idea (Continued)

::content::

- We use inferential statistics to evaluate whether the patterns we see in our sample data are likely to reflect ==true effects in the population==, or if they could have arisen just by chance due to variability.

<p v-click>

- We can think of all statistical tests as comparing **signal** to **noise**:
    - Signal: the meaningful effect we are trying to detect (e.g., difference between groups, association between variables)
    - Noise: the random variability that obscures the signal (e.g., individual differences, measurement error)

</p>

<p v-click>

- The key question: **Is the signal strong enough relative to the noise to conclude that there is a real effect in the population?**

</p>

<p v-click>

- Our ==test statistics== quantify this signal-to-noise ratio.

</p>

# Signal-to-Noise in Practice

::left::
**Examples of how we quantify signal**
- Group mean differences (ANOVA, *t*-tests)
- Strength of association (correlation, regression coefficients)

::right::

**Examples of how we quantify noise**
- Standard deviation
- Standard error
- Within-group variance
- Residual error in regression

# Review: Standard Deviation and Standard Error

::left::

### **Standard Deviation (SD)**
- One measure of the **spread of individual scores** (variability) in a sample/population
- High SD: lots of variability among individuals
- Low SD: individuals are similar to each other

<p v-click>

- When there is more variability in the data, it is harder to detect true effects (signal) because the noise is larger.

</p>

<p v-click>

*Example: High variability in anxiety levels can make it more challenging to identify whether a treatment is effective, as the noise (individual differences) may obscure the signal (treatment effect).*

</p>

::right::

<p v-click>

### **Standard Error (SE)**
- Equal to the SD of the sampling distribution of the mean.
- Describes **how much sample means vary** across repeated samples. Quantifies uncertainty in our estimate of the population mean.
- Answers the question: *If we took many samples from the same population, how much would their means differ from each other?*

</p>

<p v-click>

- Formula:
  **SE = SD / √n**

</p>

:: title ::

# Why Sample Size Matters

:: content ::

- Remember, test statistics depend on both effect size (signal) and variability (noise).
- **Sample size (n)** directly affects the standard error (SE):
  **SE = SD / √n**
- Larger samples reduce the SD of the sampling distribution (SE), making our estimates more precise.
- This reduces noise in our signal-to-noise ratio, and makes it easier to detect true effects.

# Tests We've Covered
:: content ::
### *Z*-test
==***Does our sample mean come from a population with a known mean?***==

- Population SD (σ) **must** be known (rare in practice).
- Uses the standard normal distribution.
- Example: testing if a new teaching method changes test scores compared to student scores from prior years with known population mean and SD.

# Tests We've Covered

:: content ::
### Single-sample *t*-test
==***Does our sample mean come from a population with a known mean?***==
- Population SD (σ) is unknown and must be estimated with sample SD (s).
- Uses *t* distribution (wider tails than *z* distribution).
- Example: testing if average sleep duration in a sample differs from the recommended 8 hours.

### Paired-samples *t*-test
==***Are the means of two related measurements different?***==
- Compare two measurements from the **same participants**.
- Uses **difference scores** (e.g., post-test - pre-test).
- Tests whether the mean difference is significantly different from zero.
- Uses *t* distribution.

### One-way Between-Subjects ANOVA
==***Are the means of 3 or more independent groups different?***==

- Compares **3+ independent groups**
- *F* statistic compares:
  - **Between-group variance** (signal)
  - **Within-group variance** (noise)
- To determine *which* means differ, post-hoc tests (Tukey, Bonferroni) are required.

Example: testing if different teaching methods lead to different average test scores across multiple classes.

### One-way Repeated-Measures ANOVA
==***Are the means of 3 or more related measurements different?***==
- Compares **3+ conditions** in same participants.
- Accounts for within-subject variability (reduces noise).
- *F* statistic compares:
  - **Between-condition variance** (signal)
  - **Within-condition variance** (noise) ==after accounting for subject variability==
- Example: testing if reaction times differ across three types of stimuli presented to the same participants.

### Factorial ANOVA
==***Are the means of groups defined by multiple independent variables different?***==

- Compares means across levels of **2+ independent variables (factors)**
- Tests:
  - Main effects
  - Interactions
- Interactions allow effects of one IV to depend on levels of another
- Example: testing effects of drug type and dosage on symptom reduction.

# Tests We've Covered

:: content ::
### Correlation
==***Are two continuous variables linearly related?***==

- Measures linear association between two continuous variables (X and Y)
- Quantified by **Pearson's *r***, which indicates:
  - Strength (magnitude) of association
  - Direction (positive/negative) of association
- Can test significance of correlation by converting *r* to a *t*-statistic.
    - Significance indicates whether the observed correlation is likely due to chance.
    - Depends on effect size (*r*) and sample size (n).
- Example: examining relationship between study time and exam scores.

# Tests We've Covered

:: content ::
### Simple Linear Regression
==***Can we predict Y from X?***==

- Predicts continuous outcome variable (Y) from a single continuous predictor (X)
- Finds best-fit line: $Y = bX + a$ by minimizing squared errors between observed and predicted Y values.
- Produces: slope (b), intercept (a), and residuals (errors).
- Can examine standardized (β) or unstandardized (b) coefficients.
- Can assess model fit (R²) and significance of slope.
- Example: predicting shark attacks based on water temperature.

# Tests We've Covered

:: content ::

### Multiple Regression
==***Can we predict Y from multiple Xs?***==
- Predicts continuous outcome variable (Y) from multiple continuous predictors (X1, X2, ...) simultaneously.
- Allows testing unique contributions of each predictor.
- Can include interaction terms to assess moderation effects.
- Produces coefficients for each predictor, overall model fit (R²), and significance tests.
- There are methods that allow us to include both continuous and categorical predictors (dummy coding) *as well as* both between- and within-subjects variables (mixed-effects models).
- Example: predicting job performance from experience, education, and personality traits.

# Assumptions of Parametric Tests

:: content ::
The tests we have discussed so far assume that:
- Data are randomly sampled
- Observations are independent
- Distribution of scores (or residuals) in the population is **approximately normal**
- Outcome variable is ==numeric==
    - Interval or ratio scale
    - Not ordinal or categorical

<p v-click>

- When assumptions hold: parametric tests are powerful.
- When badly violated: results can be biased.

# Non-Parametric Tests: Overview

:: content ::
- Non-parametric tests do **not** assume normality or specific distributions.
- They are more **robust** to violations of assumptions.
- Often used with:
  - Small sample sizes
  - Ordinal or categorical data
  - Extreme outliers

# Example: Chi-Square (χ²) Tests

:: content ::
- Used for **categorical** data.
- Equivalent to ANOVA / *t*-tests for categorical outcomes.
- Chi-square evaluates whether **observed** frequencies differ from **expected** frequencies.

<br>

## Two main types:
- Goodness-of-fit (one categorical / nominal variable )
- Test of independence (two categorical / nominal variables)

:: title ::
# Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test

:: content ::
- Used when examining whether **one categorical variable** matches expected distribution.
- Compares observed frequencies in each category to expected frequencies based on a theoretical distribution (e.g., uniform distribution).
- Null hypothesis: observed frequencies match expected frequencies.
- If large discrepancies: reject null hypothesis.
- Null distribution: chi-square distribution with (k - 1) degrees of freedom (k = number of categories).
- Example: Testing whether the distribution of favorite Top 5 Spotify artists differs from uniform distribution.

### R function: chisq.test()

- Ethical research practices are essential for credible, trustworthy science.
- Misuse of statistics can lead to misleading or false conclusions.
- Researchers have a responsibility to conduct and report research honestly and transparently.
- There are entire courses on research ethics. Today, we're just going to briefly cover some key issues related to data analysis and reporting.

# P-Hacking & Researcher Degrees of Freedom

:: content ::
- **P-hacking**: manipulating data or analyses to achieve statistically significant results ($p < 0.05$).
- Examples:
  - **Cherry-picking**: selecting only certain data points or analyses that support a desired conclusion.
  - **Data dredging**: conducting multiple analyses without pre-specifying them, increasing the chance of finding false positives.
  - **Post-hoc hypothesizing**: creating hypotheses after seeing the data, rather than before.


<p v-click>

- **Researcher degrees of freedom**: choices researchers make during data collection, analysis, and reporting that can influence results.
    - Examples: deciding when to stop data collection, which variables to include, how to handle outliers, etc.

:: title ::
# P-Hacking & Researcher Degrees of Freedom: Example

:: content ::
- Imagine a researcher testing a new drug's effect on anxiety.
- They collect data from 20 participants and find $p = .08$ (not significant).
- They decide to:
  - Add 10 more participants → $p = .04$ (significant).
  - Exclude 2 outliers → $p = .03$ (more significant).
  - Test multiple outcome measures → find one with $p = .02$ (significant).
- They report only the final significant result, ignoring the initial non-significant findings.

# Why is P-Hacking a Problem?

:: content ::
- Increases false positive rates (Type I errors).
- Undermines the credibility of research findings.
- Can lead to incorrect conclusions and wasted resources.
- Erodes public trust in science.

<p v-click>

- Contributes to the =="replication crisis"== in psychology and other fields.

:: title ::
# The replication crisis in psychology

:: content ::
- Many high-profile findings fail to replicate in subsequent studies, often due to questionable research practices like p-hacking.
- Some findings that have been difficult to replicate include:
    - Power posing effects  (e.g., standing in a "powerful" pose increases confidence and risk-taking)
    - Priming effects (e.g., reading words related to old age makes people walk slower)
    - Neonatal imitation (e.g., newborns imitating facial expressions)

- These and other replication failures have led to increased scrutiny of research practices and calls for greater transparency and rigor in psychological science.

<p v-click>

Some solutions:
- Pre-register studies to specify analyses in advance.
- Use robust statistical methods to reduce false positives.
    - Example: Adjust for multiple comparisons.
